  ### Virtual Enviornment
  Make sure before development to deploy a virtual enviornment
  
  Run this command to build an enviornment: 
  
    $ python3 -m venv (enviornment name)
  
  ## Guide
  
  First clone the repository from Github and switch to the new directory:

    $ git clone git@github.com/USERNAME/(project name).git
    $ cd (project name)
  
  Then activate your virtual enviornment and install django
    
    $ source (enviornment name)/bin/activate
    $ pip3 install django
  
  Then apply the migrations:

    $ python3 manage.py migrate
  
  Now run your development server:

    $ python3 manage.py runserver
